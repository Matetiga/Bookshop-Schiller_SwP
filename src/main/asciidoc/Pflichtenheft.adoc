== Task Definition


The Bookstore {company_name} is seeking a web application to expand its business model,
allowing for efficient sales and management of books as well as potential non-book items.
The application will support user, item, and order management to streamline operations for
employees while enhancing the shopping experience for customers.

The application will support multiple roles: Customers, Employees, and Admins. Each user
can create an account, view and edit personal data, and delete their account if desired.
Customers will be able to browse the catalog without logging in but must log in to access
the shopping cart and place orders. In addition, employees and Admins can also be customers
and enjoy similar functionality. Employee permissions include managing the inventory, such
as adding, editing and removing books and other items, viewing customer and order
lists, confirming payments, and canceling orders. Admins, in addition to all employee
permissions, have full system access, including adding or removing employees. It is
required that there must always be at least one active Admin in the system.

The Item Management system will include books and other potential items like merchandise
or calendars. Each book entry must include fields for the author, publisher, ISBN, a brief
description, and a cover image, with books classified into at least one of the following
genres: Fiction, Non-Fiction, Entertainment, or Guide with the possibility to add or edit
genres later on. Employees and Admins should have the ability to edit and add both books
and genres, ensuring that each book belongs to at least one genre. Non-book items, such as
merchandise, will have fields for name, description, price, and stock, and all items will
receive unique identifiers, Stock management is essential: items should not decrease in
stock unless purchased, and any item that runs out of stock must display as such to customers.

The Order Management system will allow customers to order items with payment options of
either invoice or cash on pickup. The order date will automatically record on the day the
order is placed, and the expected delivery date is set to three days after this order date.
Employees will handle shipments manually once payment is confirmed, with system-generated
updates on order and delivery statuses as they progress. The inventory is only adjusted when
the payment process is initiated, ensuring stock is correctly accounted for.

A Financial Overview feature, available only to Admins, will provide a monthly revenue
summary without a breakdown by category. This overview will include a simple chart
displaying monthly revenue trends over time, with historical data accessible as well.
Revenue should be calculated upon order payment confirmation (immediate for cash orders)
and will appear in the financial overview as earnings for the respective order month.

The User Interface (UI) will feature a navigational bar with different options depending on
permissions set according to each user's role. The login screen will be universal across
roles. The application will support search and filter options, enabling users to search
by genre, author, and title and sort results by author, title, price, and release date.
Stock availability will also be displayed in real-time, providing visibility for any
items that are out of stock.





== Product Usage

The system will serve as a web shop for {company_name} to sell books, calendars,
and merchandise. The software will be hosted on a server and made accessible to customers
via the internet through standard web browsers.

The platform will be compatible with and visually optimized for all major web browsers to
ensure a seamless user experience.

The main users will be customers, familiar with standard website navigation, along with
administrators and employees, who may not have technical expertise.

The system is designed to operate without the need for technical maintenance. All data
will be stored persistently in a database and accessible directly through the application.

== Data Model

=== Class Diagram
The (analysis) class diagram is supposed to give an overview of the domain in the context of the system, which shall be developed in the scope of this project.

NOTE: The domain model is supposed to explain the concepts and terms of the domain and their relationships. Please, try to avoid technical terms or implementation knowledge.

=== Classes and Enumerations
The following table gives an overview of the classes/enumerations used in the domain model.
Therefore, this section is a subset of the <<Glossary, glossary>> and shall be used to provide every stakeholder a common understanding of central terms and concepts of the domain of the system.

:Bookshop_Description: Central class of the system representing the bookshop itself.

[[classes_enumerations]]
|===
|Class/Enumeration      |Description
|Büchershop        |The basis of the system ( book shop)
|Person            |A not registered account that uses the system (with limited capabilities)
|Customer          |A person that has register into he system and can perform basic shopping actions
|Employee          |A worker, created by the admin, with more managment capabilities
|Admin             |The manager of the book store, with full access to the entire system 
|Cart              |The virtual cart, where chosen items will be stored for later purchase creating an order
|Order             |Created by the purchase action of an user, which contains the item's information quantity, initialized as "not payed", which can  later be changed by the worker/admin.
|Status            |Are the different possible states of an Order, managed by the admin/worker +
_OPEN:_ The order has been created but is still unpayed +
_PAID:_ The order has been payed and the product's stock has been reduced +
_DELIVERED:_ An order chosen to be delivered, has been received by the buyer +
_CANCELLED:_ An order that is no longer wanted and must be cancelled.
|ProductQuantity   |Keeps track of the stock of a product used for the cart and check if there is enough for a purchase
|Product           |A parent class that wraps the different items that are sold  in the shop, which works as a blueprint to later add new products
|Book              |A child  of the class Product, with extra specific qualities
|Calendar          |A child of the class Product, considered as an extra item sold by the book shop
|Merch             |A child of the class Product, used for various extra items 
|Catalog           |Contains all the products that are to be shown to the public, with the possibility to buy them.
|Inventory         |Contains all the products, including the possibility to edit/add/delete them. Meant to be used only by the worker and admin
|===

== Acceptance Testing

Acceptance tests are used to determine, whether or not the delivered software system fulfills the requirements of the client during the actual usage.
The following table shows which acceptance tests the software system does have to pass at the end of the project in order to satisfy the client and complete the contract (regarding the requirements).

NOTE: Acceptance tests can be derived from the use cases and the respective sequence diagrams, but also from other parts
of the SRS.
Each sequence diagram represents one scenario of a use case (e.g. successful order completion).
However, another scenario of the same use case (e.g. failed order because of insufficient stock) would require an own sequence diagram as well as at least an own acceptance test.
It is also highly necessary to design the test cases in a measurable manner to be able to determine if the acceptance test has passed or not.

NOTE: There are multiple different types of acceptance tests. In this course, we mainly focus on documenting test cases,
which show that the functional requirements are fulfilled from the perspective of the user (UAT).

NOTE: This list of acceptance tests does obviously not cover every use case. The process is mostly the same for every
acceptance test case, which is why we provide only some examples to show you the ropes.

NOTE: It is often also necessary to create test cases for non-functional requirements in order to prove that the
requirement has been fulfilled by the finished system.

[[Glossary]]
== Glossary

The glossary contains a list of all words and phrases used in this project, which require a description to avoid misunderstandings between stakeholders.
Please also consult the list of <<actors, actors>>, the list of <<Stakeholders, stakeholders>> and the <<classes_enumerations, domain model>> for further definitions of terms.

NOTE: Some terms can be used regularly during a project, while all involved stakeholders think that the meaning is
obvious. This not necessarily the case though, as different domains of expertise can mean different levels of knowledge or simply a different understanding of a term. +
An example from a previous year of this course: +
Imagine a shift schedule, where every shift is occupied by 3 different kinds of staff.
The manager responsible for the schedule would use the term "shift" to describe the whole timeslot with all 3 involved staff members (e.g. "shift X is gonna be hard for you guys, prepare yourselves").
One of the staff members occupying one of these slots would use the term "shift" to describe his one slot (of the three) in one timeslot of the day (e.g. "My shift this time puts me in touch with the customers, while the other two can relax in the warehouse"). +
While this is common sense and does not really affect communication in the real world, it becomes an issue if you have to design a system which represents such a shift schedule. You could - in this case - use "shift" as in the understanding of the manager and use "slot" or "cell" to model what the staff member meant.
In such cases, you have to force all stakeholders to use this common wording in order to avoid misunderstandings.
